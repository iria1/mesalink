MesaLink is a memory-safe and OpenSSL-compatible TLS library. Since 2014, the
industry has seen a huge loss due to memory vulnerabilities in TLS
stacks, such as the infamous "Heartbleed" bug. MesaLink is created with the goal of
eliminating memory vulnerabilities in TLS stacks. MesaLink is written in Rust, a
programming language that guarantees memory safety. This significantly reduces
the attack surfaces, which facilitates auditing and restricting the
remaining attack surfaces. MesaLink is cross-platform and provides
OpenSSL-compatible APIs. It works seamlessly in desktop, mobile, and IoT
devices. With the growth of the ecosystem, MesaLink would also be adopted in the
server environment in the future.

To get better functionality and strong security guarantees, MesaLink
follows three rules-of-thumb for designing a hybrid, memory-safe architecture,
as proposed by the [Rust SGX SDK](https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk)
project:

1. Unsafe components must not taint safe components, especially for public APIs
   and data structures.
2. Unsafe components should be as small as possible and decoupled from safe
   components.
3. Unsafe components should be explicitly marked during deployment and ready to
   upgrade.

## Feature highlights

 * **Memory safety**. MesaLink and its dependencies are written in
   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), a programming language that guarantees
   memory safety. This extremely reduces the attack surfaces of an exposed TLS stack, 
   leaving the remaining attack surfaces auditable and restricted.
 * **Flexibility**. MesaLink offers flexible configurations tailored to various
   needs, such as IoT, connected home, automobiles, the cloud and more.
 * **Simplicity**. MesaLink does not support obsolete or legacy TLS features to 
 prevent misconfigurations that can introduce vulnerabilities.
 * **Compatibility**. MesaLink provides OpenSSL-compatible APIs. This makes it a
   breeze to port an existing OpenSSL project.
 * **Future proof**. MesaLink will support quantum-safe ciphersuites,
   safe-guarding TLS connections against even quantum computers.

MesaLink depends on two Rust crates: [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) and
[sct](https://github.com/ctz/sct.rs). With them, MesaLink provides the following
features that are considered secure for most use cases:

* TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 draft 22
* ALPN and SNI support
* Forced hostname validation
* Safe and fast crypto primitives from BoringSSL
* ECDHE key exchange with forwarding secrecy
* AES-256-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305 bulk encryption
* Built-in Mozilla's CA root certificates

## Building the MesaLink library from source

MesaLink is currently only available on Linux, Android and macOS. We will
introduce support for other platforms in future releases.

To build MesaLink from source, the following tools are needed:

  * m4
  * autoconf
  * automake
  * libtool
  * curl
  * make
  * gcc
  * rustc
  * cargo

On Ubuntu, you can install them with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install m4 autoconf automake libtool make gcc curl
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

On other platforms, please use the corresponding package managing tool to
install them before proceeding. Note that MesaLink always targets the
**current** stable and nightly release of Rust. We do not guarantee backward
compatibility with older releases.

The source code can be downloaded from Github:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mesalock-linux/mesalink.git
```

To configure MesaLink, execute the following:

```
$ ./autogen.sh [OPTIONS]
```

By default, `autogen.sh` generates the `configure` script and runs it with the
default configuration. A non-exhaustive list of options that can be passed to
either of these scripts are shown as follows:

```
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [/usr/local]
  --includedir=DIR        C header files [PREFIX/include]
  --build=BUILD           configure for building on BUILD [guessed]
  --host=HOST             cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST [BUILD]
  --enable-debug          Add debug code/turns off optimizations (yes|no)
                          [default=no]
  --enable-rusthost       Set the Rust host for cross compilation (default:
                          disabled)
  --enable-client         Enable TLS client-side APIs (default: enabled)
  --enable-server         Enable TLS server-side APIs (default: enabled)
  --enable-errorstrings   Enable error string table (default: enabled)
  --enable-aesgcm         Enable AES-GCM bulk encryption (default: enabled)
  --enable-chachapoly     Enable Chacha20Poly1305 bulk encryption (default:
                          enabled)
  --enable-tls13          Enable TLS 1.3 draft (default: enabled)
  --enable-x25519         Enable Curve25519 for key exchange (default:
                          enabled)
  --enable-ecdh           Enable curve secp256r1 and secp384r1 for key
                          exchange (default: enabled)
  --enable-ecdsa          Enable curve secp256r1 and secp384r1 for signature
                          verification (default: enabled)
```

At the end of the configuration, a configuration summary is shown. For example,

```

Finally, simple run `make` to compile the MesaLink library.

```
$ make
```

## Examples
MesaLink comes with two examples that demonstrate a TLS client and a TLS
server. Both of them are located at `examples/`.

The client example connects to a remote HTTPS server and prints the server's
response.

```
$ ./examples/client/client api.ipify.org
[+] Negotiated ciphersuite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, enc_length=16, version=TLS1.2
[+] Sent 85 bytes

GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: api.ipify.org
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: identity

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Cowboy

1.2.3.4
[+] TLS protocol version: TLS1.2

```

The server example comes with a pair of certificate and private key. The
certificate file is in the PEM format and contains a chain of certificates from
the server's certificate to the root CA certificate. The private key file
contains a PKCS8-encoded private key in the PEM format. Once the server is up
and running, open [https://127.0.0.1:8443](https://127.0.0.1:8443) and expect to
see the hello message.

```
$ ./examples/server/server

## Unit tests
MesaLink uses cargo for unit tests. The test cases are designed for the
default configuration of MesaLink, in which all the optional features are
enabled. So before running the test cases, please rebuild MesaLink with the
default configuration:

```
$ ./configure
$ make
$ cargo test
```

## BoringSSL SSL tests
[BoGo](https://github.com/google/boringssl/tree/master/ssl/test) is BoringSSL's
protocol level test suite. We have ported BoGo for testing the functionality and
compatibility of MesaLink. To run BoGo test cases, run the following:

```
$ cargo build --release --examples
$ (cd bogo && ./fetch-and-build && ./runme)
```

## Crypto benchmarks
MesaLink's underlying crypto library is
[**Ring**](https://github.com/briansmith/ring), a safe and fast crypto using
Rust. To evaluate the speed and throughput of MesaLink, we developed new
benchmarks for OpenSSL and wolfSSL based on the
[crypto-bench](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench) project. A summary of
the available benchmarks is shown as follows:

| Benchmark                           | Ring | OpenSSL/LibreSSL | wolfSSL |
| ----------------------------------- | :--: | :--------------: | :-----: |
| SHA-1 & SHA-256 & SHA-512           |  ✔️   |        ✔️         |    ✔️    |
| AES-128-GCM & AES-256-GCM           |  ✔️   |        ✔️         |    ✔️    |
| Chacha20-Poly1305                   |  ✔️   |        ✔️         |    ✔️    |
| ECDH (suite B) key exchange         |  ✔️   |                  |         |
| X25519 (Curve25519) key exchange    |  ✔️   |                  |         |

To run the benchmarks, run the following command with nightly Rust. Note you
must have OpenSSL/LibreSSL or wolfSSL installed to run the corresponding
benchmarks.

```
$ rustup install nightly-2017-12-24
$ rustup default nightly-2017-12-24
$ cd crypto-bench && ./bench_all
```
